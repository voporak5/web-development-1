        How to Succeed in this class
    </h2>

    <h4>
        &emsp;- Pay attention to lectures
        <br>
        &emsp;- Do in class assignments
        <br>
        &emsp;- Ask questions such as "Can you slow down?" or "Can you explain it differently?"
        <br>
        &emsp;- Practice
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You won't advance without reinforcing the material outside of class and you'll be
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;stuck when we get to more advanced topics
        <br>
        &emsp;- Do homework
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It might take between 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on comfortability level
        &emsp;- Be on time
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Don't procrastinate and wait until the last second. I won't help you 4am the day
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the assignment is due.
        <br>
        &emsp;- Use recommended software.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The software will make web development significantly easier.
        <br>
        &emsp;- Just. Get. Started.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If things not making sense is preventing you from even getting started then
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sometimes just opening up a file and typing stuff will help just <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;like it did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiaVFg8U6rU&ab_channel=MemeFountain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Spongebob </a>.
        <br>
        &emsp;- Do the readings
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The readings will reinforce the weekly material.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The readings also serve as a reference for you as you build your sites.

        Probably the easiest thing you'll find installed on the machines at school. Very common especially since it isn't exclusively for web development. Don't confuse this with the standard Visual Studio which you can use for web development, but Visual Studio Code is much more friendly.

        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brackets</a>
    </h4>

    <h5>
        I highly recommend this one because the autofill is very smart and it has other cool features like showing you the color in a preview as you're typing the color out.

        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notepad++</a>
    </h4>

    <h5>
        This gets the job done and lets you focus on typing out your HTML without distracting you from other windows, editor features, etc. because it's just a better version of Notepad intended for programming. Also it also has intellisense if you write PHP. Brackets does this too but you have to set it up.

        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TextEdit</a>

    <h5>
        Mac version of Notepad so definitely not ideal. It also tries to save your files as rich text files (.rtf) which is just a text file (.txt) with the ability to handle formatting similar to a word doc.

        Plain text editor on Windows that definitely will allow you to get the job done but you need to know what you are doing since there are no autofill features. Be sure you save your files as .html

        Submitting Assignments
    </h2>


    <h4>
        For this class your assignments will need to be uploaded to Github. If you cannot upload to Github, then you can submit your work to Canvas. You will receive a 10% deduction for uploading to Canvas.
        <br>
        <br>
        After you have uploaded your work to Github you will need to verify that your work is
        actually published, images are working, links are not broken.
        <br>
        <br>
        You will receive reduced points for any issues and the work will be treated as if it was not worked.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once you have done all of that then you will submit your Github website link to Canvas.

                        Github is what we call a repository service. You can think of a repository service similar to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. except the primary intent is for storing code. You can actually store whatever files you want, but there are special functions developed around the assumption you're using it to store code. Github provides other features that this class is in no way meant to go over. An additional feature that Github provides is the ability to host a website that you've been developing. The functionality of the website can be pretty limited, but for this class it provides everything we care about. There are other services such as Bitbucket that provide the same or similar features, but Github is the most common.
