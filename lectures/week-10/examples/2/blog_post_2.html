          <h4>Domestic Short-Hair</h4>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> 05/02/2020</p>
        <p><strong>Gotcha Day:</strong> 07/02/2020</p>
          <p>Back in July 2020, my boyfriend Francisco (now my fiancé) and I were living in our first apartment. I was working as a personal banker, and one day, a business customer at the bank came in for the usual deposits. Before leaving, she asked me and my coworkers if any of us wanted a kitten. She told us that her elderly neighbor's caretaker found a mom cat and her kittens in the backyard. She showed us cute pictures of calico and tuxedo kittens and left her phone number.</p>
          <p>I've always been a big fan of animals, having grown up with pets. I knew our apartment allowed pets, but the challenge was convincing my boyfriend, who claimed he "hated" cats. I promised to take care of everything and pay for it myself—I just really wanted a cat. Surprisingly, he agreed! I messaged the business customer right away and went to pick out a kitten. When I got there, there were six kittens, three tuxedo boys, two calico girls, and the cutest black kitten that immediately came up to play with me. I fell in love with him, and since he wasn't in any of the pictures, I thought it was meant to be. I brought him home, and of course, my boyfriend ended up falling in love with him too (goodbye, cat hater!).</p>
        
        <h2>Kylo Luna</h2>

        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> 04/15/2022</p>
        <p><strong>Gotcha Day:</strong> 06/11/2022</p>
          <p>Jump to June 2022, and Francisco's older sister asked us to drive her to a farm to get a puppy. We saw the parent dogs, a Siberian Husky and a Golden Retriever, and a litter of six puppies coming out of the barn. Francisco's sister had already picked hers, but I noticed my boyfriend was eyeing two particular puppies. He came up to me and said, "I want one." Knowing I had already brought home a cat without much discussion, I couldn't say no. Even though I secretly wanted a puppy too, I left the decision entirely up to him. The owners were giving the puppies away for free, as it was an unplanned litter, and they just wanted them to go to loving homes. Francisco chose the one that had been following him around, and he fell head over heels for him when he picked him up.</p>
          
        <h2>Appa Luna</h2>

          <h4>Siamese</h4>
        <p><strong>Possible Birthday:</strong> 02/28/2021</p>
        <p><strong>Gotcha Day:</strong> 09/29/2022</p>
        <p>Fast forward to late September 2022, I was walking ourß dog Kylo around the neighborhood when we stumbled upon a stray kitten meowing and rubbing against us near some bushes. Stray animals were pretty common in our town, but because it was a kitten, I decided to take him in temporarily, get him some food and water, and figure out what to do. I called my boyfriend, and he agreed to take care of him while we tried to find his family or someone to take him. Despite our efforts over the next week, we couldn't locate his family or any missing posters. A trip to the vet revealed that he wasn't a kitten but a year-and-a-half to two-year-old Siamese, likely the runt of his litter, and shockingly, he didn't have a chip. Worried that no one would take care of him properly and having already fallen in love with the little guy, my boyfriend and I decided to keep him.</p>
