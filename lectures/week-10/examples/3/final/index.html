                In 1999, an alien force invaded every technology on Earth.  In response, humanity banned technology and came to rely upon magic.  Not long after, mankind created "Gears": an artifical race of biological weapons that would wage war on humanity for the next thousand years.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sol Badguy, a Gear man with his own autonomy, has a simple goal: kill the Gears, That Man who created them, and punch through anyone who gets in his way.</p>

                <br>
                The series boasts fast-paced 2D fighting with a high level of freedom granted by its unique mechanic, the Roman Cancel, which allows a player to correct mistaken inputs, continue combos in unorthodox ways, and more.  Series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari imbues his own love for rock and metal into his work to create a high-octane atmosphere.
