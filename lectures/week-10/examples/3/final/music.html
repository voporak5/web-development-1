                </div>
                <img src="../images/final/daisuke.png" class="daisuke">Series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari is hands-on with every part of <span class="italic">Guilty Gear</span>: he works on designing, writing, and producing the games.  It's safe to say any part of a <span class="italic">Guilty Gear</span> game has had Daisuke's touch added to it.  One of his most impactful roles, however, is his work composing music.
                <br>
                <br>
                Daisuke's love for all kinds of rock and metal comes through in all of his works.  He takes plenty of inspiration from Queen--Sol Badguy's favorite album.  He doesn't limit himself to that, though: he experiments with all sorts of genres, including David Bowie-esque ballads, speed metal, pop punk, and progressive rock.
                <br>
                <br>
                The music is a huge part of <span class="italic">Guilty Gear</span>'s identity, but Daisuke imbues his musical energy into every part of the series.  One of the series' major antagonists, I-No, is designed after the holographic colors of a CD.  Other characters include Axl Low, Slayer (as in the band), and Elphelt's motifs of Guns & Roses.  The magic system of <span class="italic">Guilty Gear</span> is based entirely on music: spells are 'tuned' with 'chords.'  <span class="italic">Guilty Gear</span> is a fighting game, but it's really a series about love and rock.

                "Freesia" (<span class="italic">Guilty Gear Xrd</span>) is an epic ballad hearkening back to Daisuke's love for Freddy Mercury.

                "Holy Orders ~Be Just Or Be Dead~" (<span class="italic">Guilty Gear</span>) is one of Daisuke's most popular pieces, full of shredding guitars.
