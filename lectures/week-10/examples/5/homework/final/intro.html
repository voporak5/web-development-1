	<p>This is a sort of basic escape room done in HTML. There is no programming at all as I thought it would be fun to limit myself on the capabilites of basic HTML & CSS. It can absolutely be brute forced because of these limitations but please do not do this :)<br><br>
	There is a map, however it is a static image that does not update. However, rooms are marked on the map and your position will be in the tab's title. Use this to keep track of your position!<br><br>
	For the sake of my sanity, there is a lot of reusing of assets and while I can go and comment things out manually for every page, that would take a while! All four buttons for movement will always be present, but they will only have functionality if the movement is valid. For example, if there's a wall on your right, when you click the East button, nothing happens. Keep that in mind if a button does nothing and consult the map! Thank you for reading, and have fun!
