    <h2>
        Wireframing
    </h2>

    <h4>
        Frankly this topic is not all that complicated, but in a nutshell wireframing is preparing a skeleton of the website structure to give stakeholders (whoever you are making the website for) or even yourself an idea of what the website will look like.
        <br>
        <br>
        Up to this point you have all probably realized how time consuming building a website is but imagine you spent the same amount of time or more to then be told what you built was incorrect. It would be a huge waste of time and money to have to start over or worse, you are not compensated for the extra time you have to spend rebuilding it correctly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Putting the design on paper (or digital) and getting approval on a design beforehand clears up any confusion there might be as well as saving time and money. Plus, when it is time to build the site everyone on the team has a reference they can refer to so fewer mistakes are made.
        <br>
        <br>
        Keep in mind that the wireframe is an abstract design and it is not required to put in any actual text or images that may appear on the final site. You are simply allocating space for elements. Typically you might place a rectangle with an X going through it to represent an image and a bunch of horizontal lines to represent where bodies of text may go.

        Tools
    </h2>

    <h4>
        There are many tools you can use to put together a wireframe for a client in addition to good ol pen and paper. Some are free and some are not.
        <br>
        <br>
        Check out <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/best-wireframe-tools/" target="_blank">This</a> link for a list of some of the "best" tools.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of the tools simply draw out wireframes and some are interactive that you could potentially hand to a client and say this is what your website will look and feel like. It might feel like at that point you may as well use the tool to build the website but then you lose control of the backend. We refer to these kind of tools as WYSIWYG (wiz-e-wig) What You See Is What You Get.
        <br>
        <br>
        The tool I use most (not specificaly for websites) is <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" target="_blank">draw.io</a>. It is simple and straight to the point. Plus it gives me an option of where to store my designs such as google drive or dropbox allowing me to load them later.

        Let's take a look at my favorite website in the whole wide world <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br>
        Your task is to pick any page and come up with a design. Spend no more than 30 minutes. Feel free to chat with each other.
        <br>
        <br>
        Use <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" target="_blank">draw.io</a> since it is easy to get up and running to make your mockup or some other software such as illustrator.

    <h2>
        Final Projects
    </h2>

    <h4>
        As of today there are 5 weeks left so it is time to start working on your website!
        <br>
        Due by the end of today (11:59pm) is a proposal for the website you want to work on. Simply submit a paragraph of your idea.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are the criteria you will need to adhere to...
        <ul>
            <li>Your website needs to minimally have 5 pages</li>
            <li>Your website needs to minimally have 10 images</li>
            <li>You can get these images from anywhere</li>
            <li>Your website needs to have a navigation (I need to be able to get to the pages and back home just like the navigation at the very top of these website)</li>
            <li>The nav should be the same on every page</li>
            <li>The majority of your styles should be in stylesheets</li>
            <li>Each page needs to look different in terms of layout</li>
            <li>You may reuse a page layout for up to 3 pages or in otherwords you must have at least 3 unique webpage designs</li>
            <li>Make your site colorful. Use a color theme generator if you need help</li>
            <li>You can think outside of the box, make a text adventure game or a maze and change out the image of the maze depending on where you are</li>
            <li>If the website you want to build has cool features that take a lot of work to implement you may be approved for fewer pages depending on the idea such as using a new language such as PHP to store data into a text file that is stored on the website</li>
            <li>If something sounds interesting but you're unsure how to start we can talk like saving/loading information with PHP</li>
            <li>Late project assignments will be 10% deduction each day late</li>
            <li>Going above and beyond might earn you extra credit. If you don't need the extra credit consider going above and beyond anyways to give you an opportunity to learn new tools that will benefit you in the long run. You need to tell me what extra stuff you did to be eligible for extra credit!!!</li>
            <li>Additionaly pages beyond 5 could also earn you extra credit.</li>
            <li>I will award up to 10% extra credit</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>
        Also Due Next Week Final Project Wireframe
    </h2>

    <h4>
        You must submit a wireframe for each page that you will have on your site. Ambiguous submissions will receive ambiguous points. Don't submit something that says "here are a couple of images and the rest I'll figure out later" because I might give you not so many points. I want concrete designs that you need to adhere to in your implementation. 10% of your final project grade will depend on this.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a lot due by next week to ensure you have the maximum time to work as well as receive any feedback. The rest of the course is for working on your project and extra topics.
