    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Cameron Cintron and I am the web development 1 instructor for the Tuesday night class. Additionally, I attended Columbia from 2011-2015 and my former instructors are now my colleagues! During my time here I worked as a lab aide and helped other students with tech or homework issues. I spent a great deal of time in the game room playing League of Legends with my friends. Sometimes the room would be closed because students could get very rowdy either from League of Legends or from playing fighting games. Super Smash Bros was banned for a period of time. After graduating from CCC I went to work for my current job and have been the Lead Software Engineer for the past 6 years. Because of them I was able to earn my MS in Software Engeering from DePaul which happened last year in May. I have a wonderful wife and 2 cats who keep me company when I am not working or teaching and am currently working on Zelda Twilight Princess.</p>
