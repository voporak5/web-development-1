                <p>One of the first games I ever played. It was stupid difficult and was full of secrets that I worked<br>hard to discover. It's still as fun today as it was when it came out in 1996.<br>Fun fact Bill Gushwann worked as a liason for Sony with Naughty Dog when Sony was bringing the PSOne from Japan to the U.S. Ask him about it! He's in the credits at the very end as a special thank-you.</p>

                <p>I played these games when the HD collection came out for PS3, however I don't regret waiting because shortly after God of War 3 came out to conclude (or so I thought) the legend of Kratos. The game has so many moments from being betrayed by Zeus in the beginning who takes Kratos's god powers away, to the end when Kratos travels back in time to the war between the gods and titans so that he can bring them to the present. It was truly and amazing game and franchise. </p>

                <p>I played this game for years as a kid trying to finish it. I finally did when I was 7 and I felt accomplished. I play it every now and then again and even today it takes me a solid 50 hours to finish. The game is so longo and deep. The story is great. The music has layers. It really pushed the boundary for storytelling for 3D games at the time.</p>
