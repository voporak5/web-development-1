                even though the container is all the way
                down here. also this is text that has not been modified.

                Here's some text that's been offset relative to where it was normally going to be placed.

            <p>
                but because that text was offset, now this text is positioned as if that other relatively offset text was never modified so it looks like there's a big hole above it

            You can use float to force content that might not normally go onto the same line to be on the same line...if it fits

            This p tag content won't go onto the previous line because there is too much to fit.
