    <h2>
        Fixed, Absolute, and Relative Positioning
    </h2>

    <h4>
        Up to this point all of our elements have just been drawn from the beginning to the end and in that order. However, we can change where elements are drawn even if the code is written in a different place.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is done by changing the position property in css.
        <br>
        Have you noticed that the nav at the very top of this web page stays fixed to the top of the browser window even when we scroll down?
        <br>
        <br>
        This is accomplished by setting the value of position to fixed. It is possible that other elements will still be shown in front of it so we also need to change the z-index property which is resposible for layering elements.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fixed conted is positioned relative to the web browser window.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
.fixed {
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 9999;
}
    </pre>

    <h4>
        If we wanted our content to be positioned relative to the full web page (which may extend beyond the edge of the web browser window) and as opposed to where it's supposed to be drawn based on where we wrote HTML... (look in the top left corner)
    </h4>

    <h4 style="position: absolute; top: 70px; left: 0px;">
        then we set the position to absolute
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
.absolute {
    position: absolute;
    top: 70px;
    left: 0px;
}
    </pre>

    <h4>
        You'll notice the above style has a new property called top and left. You can add these to offset the element. I added them because the example was not correctly being positioned so I had to set the value of top to be 70px from the top and left 0px from the left.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, if we just want to slightly offset content from where it would be normally drawn, or rather relative to the position it's supposed to be drawn then we set the position to <span style="position: relative; left:-50px">relative</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        An issue you can see is that I've injected some CSS just on the word relative, however the . has not shifted as well. When you move elements with left and top, the white space does not become usable and is treated as if the element was not offset.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
.relative {
    position: relative;
    left: -50px;
}
    </pre>

    <h2>
        Floating Elements
    </h2>

    <h4 style="float: left; width: 200px">
        Another thing we can do to easily put elements into a row is to use the float property;
    </h4>

    <h4>
        As we see here, we have 2 &lt;h4&gt; tags on the same line. The one on the left looks like a column and this one fills up the remainder of the space. What the float property does is force the empty space of an element to be available and allow other elements to occupy that space even if they would normally be forced onto a new line. This is a conveninent solution as opposed to creating 2 divs and putting the content in each div. Look what happens though as this text keeps growing. It starts to wrap around the unused space of the other element. This creates an interesting effect and can be useful for writing articles.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is one caveat. Once you apply the float property to an element everything after it will attempt to "float" into that unused space.
        <br>
        <br>
        This could actually make the rest of the page look broken and to fix this you need to use the "clear" property at some point to make the rest of your content appear as intended.

        When you float content the content will be pushed as far left or right as possible depending on if you set the float value to be left or right.

    <h4>
        For this week's assignment you will be making a 10 interactable shapes.
        <br>
        <br>
        This page can look absolutely attrocious because they usually do. Overload it with styles and content!
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, add a new web page link to your homepage.

        <br>
        <br>
        Here are quality submissions that would earn full credit. The original assignment was a full website but I'm changing it to require only 1 page.
