    <h2>
        Loading External Javascript
    </h2>

    <h4>
        Last week we looked at injecting Javascript using the &lt;script&gt; tag. On a small webpage this is fine, but on a larger page or website that is more complex this could be tedious, messy, unorganized, and difficult to read much like it is with styles that are not placed in a CSS file.
        <br>
        <br>
        We can work around this in the same way we do with our CSS by putting our Javascript in an external file.
        <br>
        <br>
        Create a new file that ends with the .js extension and place it in a folder called scripts. You can download this <a href="files/example.js" download> example.js</a> file.
        <br>
        <br>
        In order to load the file you must add similar code to how we load CSS except the key difference is we place this code in the &lt;body&gt;
    </h4>


    <br>
    <br>
    <pre class="border border-white">
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/example.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>
        Something else to note is that you should place the code to load external js files at the very end of the body. This way the web page can load as fast as possible. Otherwise, the web page will stop and wait until the script is loaded before moving on. Additionally, this will guarantee that all elements are loaded which is important if your javascript relies on something such as a button.
        <br>
        <br>
        Do This

    <pre class="border border-white">
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/example.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt
    </pre>

    <h4>
        Not This

    <pre class="border border-white">
&lt;body&gt;

    <h2>
        Getting User Input
    </h2>

    <h4>
        We can collect information from the user by using tags meant for creating a form and pass it between pages as the query part of the url (or POST data which is way advanced for this class).
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are the types of inputs we have access to

        <ul>
            <li>Text Input (Text Box)</li>
            <li>Password Input (Text Box with hidden character)</li>
            <li>Text Areas (Big Text Box)</li>
            <li>Buttons</li>
            <li>Radio Dials (Multiple choice selection limited to 1 selected item)</li>
            <li>Checkboxes (Multiple choice selected allowing multiple selected items)</li>
            <li>Dropdown List</li>
            <li>Submit Button (Collects data and goes to next page)</li>
            <li>Image Button (Same as submit but is an image)</li>
            <li>File Upload Button (Destination page needs extra code to handle the file)</li>
        </ul>

    </h4>

    <form action="confirmation.html" target="_blank">
        <label>
            <p>Name:</p>
        </label>
        <input name="name">
        <br>
        <label>
            <p>Birthday:</p>
        </label>
        <input type=date name="birthday">
        <br>
        <label>
            <p>Occupation:</p>
        </label>
        <input name="occupation">
        <br>
        <label>
            <p>Pet Names:</p>
        </label>
        <input name="pets">
        <br>
        <input type="submit">
    </form>

    <br>

    <h4>
        If you want to create a collection of elements for collecting data that will be passed onto another page for processing then you can start by declaring the &lt;form&gt; tag and add the action attribute to specify the page that should be loaded when the submit button is pressed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Just like with &lt;a&gt; tags you can add the target attribute to open a new web page instead of using the current page.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
&lt;form action="submit.html" target="_blank"&gt;
  
&lt;/form&gt
    </pre>

    <h4>
        Inside the &lt;form&gt; you start adding all of the input types you wish to use
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
&lt;form action="submit.html" target="_blank"&gt;
    &lt;input&gt;
    &lt;input type="date"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt
    </pre>

    <h4>
        Although that is all you need to create input fields, if you want to pass the data to another web page then you will need to add the name attribute to each input field which will allow the input values to be appended to the end of the URL as a part of the query.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since this data is being added to the URL we should avoid spaces in the name. Any spaces in the actual input will be replaced with +
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
&lt;form action="submit.html" target="_blank"&gt;
    &lt;input name="firstName"&gt;
    &lt;input type="date" name="date"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt
    </pre>

    <h4>
        Assuming the values for firstName was Cameron and the date was 2024-05-30 then the URL that would be loaded would look like submit.html?firstName=Cameron&amp; date=2024-05-30
        <br>
        <br>
        You can look at the form at the beginning of this web page for a concrete demonstration.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some input types require a second attribute called value because they don't have a way for the user to specify a value or because they are pre-defined such as in a dropdown list.
        <br>
        <br>
        Consider a situation where you want something different to happen depending on which of 2 buttons are pressed for an account edit page. Maybe 1 button saves any changes and the other button deletes the account.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
&lt;form action="submit.html" target="_blank"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="save"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="delete"&gt;

    <h2>
        Reading Form Data With Javascript
    </h2>

    <h4>
        Consider the following scenario...
        <br>
        <br>
        You have created a quiz and want to present the results of the quiz on a separate webpage. You build the quiz usings a &lt;form&gt; which will append the results as a part of the query parameters of the URL where the results page is located (https://www.mywebsite.com/results?answer1=taco&answer2=fish).
        <br>
        <br>
        With plain HTML it's impossible to do anything based on information in the URL however, reading the data is really easy with JS.
        <br>
        <br>
        Simply use the below code.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
var answer1 = urlParams.get('answer1');
var answer2 = urlParams.get('answer2');
    </pre>

    <h4>
        Here's a challenge.
        <br>
        <br>
        Write a quick webpage that will change the background color of a website based on the information specified in the query (https://www.mywebsite.com?color=red)

    <h2>
        Conditional Logic
    </h2>

    <h4>
        What IF you want different things to happen based on the values of the data?
        <br>
        Simply put we use 3 keywords to help us out with this: if, elseif, and else.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whenever you use an if statement you need to type a set of parenthese where you will specify the conditions that need to be met in order for the code that will be executed to execute for the conditions.
        <br>
        <br>
        The same is true for typing elseif.
        <br>
        <br>
        You do not need to specify conditions when typing else because that is the fallthrough condition should all over conditions fail to be met.
        <br>
        <br>
        You essentially create a chain of checks that begin with if....can be extended with elseif....and can finish with else.
        <br>
        <br>
        You are not required to use them all however, the first check should always use the if keyword.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can have as many if/elseif/else chains as you want in your code. Double check if you are using the correct keyword as well. If you only use if then every single block of code has the potential to execute.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
var answer1 = urlParams.get('answer1');
var answer2 = urlParams.get('answer2');

if(answer1 == "taco"){
    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; The answer is correct! &lt;/h4&gt;');
}
elseif(answer1 == "hamburger"){
    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; Close but no cigar :( &lt;/h4&gt;');
}
else {
    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; You fail! &lt;/h4&gt;');
}
    </pre>

    <h4>
        When comparing equivalency you must use a double set of = signs like this ==. This is to differentiate in the code assigning a value to a variable from checking to see if the value is equal to something else.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally you can put as many conditional checks in a single statement as you like using the following operators: &amp;&amp; and ||.
        <br>
        <br>
        &amp;&amp; (and) is used to say both of these 2 separate conditions have to be met in order for the code to execute.
        <br>
        <br>
        || (or) is used to say either one of these conditions can be met for the code to execute.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can chain as many conditions in a statement as you want, you are not limited to 2.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
var answer1 = urlParams.get('answer1');
var answer2 = urlParams.get('answer2');

if(answer1 == "taco" &amp;&amp; answer2 == "fish"){
    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; You received 100%! &lt;/h4&gt;');
}
elseif(answer1 == "taco" || answer2 == "fish"){
    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; You received 50% :| &lt;/h4&gt;');
}
else {
    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; You fail! :( &lt;/h4&gt;');
}
    </pre>

    <h4>
        Additionally, it may help you to wrap conditions with parentheses if your conditions make use of both operators to ensure the logic is processed in the correct order just like in math when you wrap logic with parentheses to specify which operations need to happen first.
        <br>
        <br>
        Look at the below examples. If we don't include the parentheses then which way do you think the web browser is going to interpret what you were trying to write?
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
var answer1 = urlParams.get('answer1');
var answer2 = urlParams.get('answer2');
var answer3 = urlParams.get('answer3');

if((answer1 == "taco" &amp;&amp; answer2 == "fish") || answer3 == "sandwich"){
    
}

if(answer1 == "taco" &amp;&amp; (answer2 == "fish" || answer3 == "sandwich"){
    
}
    </pre>

    <h4>
        There are others things we can check such as not equivalent (!=), greater than(&gt;), greater or equal to(&gt;=), less than(&lt;), less than or equal to (&lt;=). The greater than or less than checks are only useful for numerical comparisons.
    </h4>

    <pre class="border border-white">
var grade = 96;

if(grade == 100){
    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; Your grade: A++! &lt;/h4&gt;');

    document.write('&lt;h4&gt; Your grade: A! &lt;/h4&gt;');
